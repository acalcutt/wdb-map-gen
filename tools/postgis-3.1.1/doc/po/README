Translation files for the PostGIS manual.

Compilation of the files require the ``poxml`` package,
part of the KDE development kit.

In language subdirectories, run ``make`` to build localized manual and
comments, ``make local-pdf`` for the pdf.

In parent directory (doc), run ``make update-po`` to update the translation
files to be in sync with the source code, ``make html-localized`` or
``make pdf-localized`` to build the localized html or pdf manual for
all enabled languages

Using transifex
---------------

Transifex web-ui to translation was setup here:
https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/postgis

Run ``make update-tx`` from the parent (doc) directory to
update the transifex command-line tool configuration,
found in ../.tx/config (only needed when new doc sources
are added);

Run ``make pull-tx`` to import remotely updated translations
and ``make push-tx`` to upload the locally update ones, after
making sure they are well-formed (``make html-localized`` succeeds).

NOTE: the recommended workflow is:

 make pull-tx
 do:
  make html-localized || edit
 until success 
 if edits:
  make push-tx
  make pull-tx
  commit changes to repo
