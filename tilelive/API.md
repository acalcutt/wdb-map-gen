```

```javascript
// z, x, y is XYZ

    // when initialization is incomplete, this will fail always.

    // obtains tile and calls callback:
    function(err, tile, options) {
        // err is set when the tile does not exist or when retrieval failed.
        // If the tile does not exist and that's OK, the error message should
        // explicitly read 'Tile does not exist' in order to be handled correctly
        // by tilelive.copy.
        // otherwise, tile is a buffer containing the compressed image data
    }
};
```

```javascript
// z, x, y is XYZ
Tilesource.prototype.getGrid = function(z, x, y, callback) {
    // when initialization is incomplete, this will fail always.

    // obtains tile and calls callback:
    function(err, tile, options) {
        // err is set when the tile does not exist or when retrieval failed.
        // otherwise, tile is a buffer containing the compressed image data
    }
};
```

```javascript
Tilesource.prototype.getInfo = function(callback) {
    // when initialization is incomplete, this will fail always.

    // obtains tile and calls callback:
    function(err, data) {
        // err is set when information retrieval failed.
        // otherwise, data is a hash containing all the information.
    }
};
```

```javascript

    // Constructor is identical to the the Tilesource constructor.
    // Tilesink and Tilesource should be one object.
}
```

```javascript
Tilesink.prototype.startWriting = function(callback) {
    // Opens the Tilestore in write mode.
    // Call the callback function when done.
    function callback(err) {
        // err is null when write mode could be established successfully.
        // err is an Error object otherwise.
    }

    // This function must be reentrant: Write mode may only be ended after the
    // same number of calls to .stopWriting(). Use a counter to keep track of
    // how often write mode was started.
};
```

```javascript
Tilesink.prototype.stopWriting = function(callback) {
    // Ends the write mode.
    // Call the callback function when the request was successfully completed.
    // This doesn't mean that write mode has been ended (see below).
    function callback(err) {
        // err is null when write mode could be established successfully.
        // err is an Error object otherwise.
    }

    // When caching and batch-writing tiles, they must be committed to the tile
    // store when this function is called, even when write mode is not ended.
    // This is true for grids as well.

    // This function must be reentrant: Write mode may only be ended after the
    // same number of calls to .stopWriting(). Use a counter to keep track of
    // how often write mode was started.
};
```

```javascript
Tilesink.prototype.putInfo = function(info, callback) {
    // Stores metadata into the tilesink. Info is a key-value hash with metadata.
    // Implementations may decide to reject invalid keys.

    function callback(err) {
        // err is null when the metadata could be written successfully.
        // err is an Error object otherwise.
    }
};
```

```javascript
Tilesink.prototype.putTile = function(z, x, y, tile, callback) {
    // Stores a tile into the data store. Parameters are in XYZ format.
    // `tile` must be a Buffer containing the compressed image.

    function callback(err) {
        // err is null when the write request was received successfully.
        // This doesn't mean that the tile was already written to the data store.
        // err is an Error object otherwise.
    }

    // Implementations may decide to cache multiple tile requests and only
    // commit them to the data store periodically to improve performance.
    // Therefore, users MUST NOT rely on this function to persist changes.
    // If you want to make sure that all changes are persisted, call
    // .stopWriting().
};
```

```javascript
Tilesink.prototype.putGrid = function(z, x, y, grid, callback) {
    // Identical to .putTile(), but grid is a JS hash containing the grid.
};
